# Assignments to a CircularList object will only involve integer indexes.
#
# When the index is an integer, it is interpreted modulo the length
# of the list.
#
# When working with slices:
# - The last argument of a slice cannot be equal to 0.
# - When the last argument of a slice is not given, it is set to 1.
# - When the first argument of a slice is not given, it is set to
#   0 or to -1 depending on the sign of the last argument.
# - When the second argument of a slice is not given, it is set to
#   len(list) or to -len(list) -1 depending on the sign of the last argument.
# - Denoting by L the CircularList object, returns a list consisting of
#   all elements of the form L[i modulo len(L)] for i ranging between first
#   (included) and second (excluded) arguments of slice, in steps given by
#   third argument of slice.
